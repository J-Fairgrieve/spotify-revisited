## About the Project
Spotify is one of the largest music streaming providers to date, founded in 2006 by Daniel Ek & Martin Lorentzon. There are over 422 million monthly active users, with around 182 million of those being paying subscribers.

Through the developer platform, you can access the audio features in order to further explore tracks, albums, artists & playlists within the platform. Some of these features include:

 - Mood: Danceability, Valence, Energy, Tempo
 - Properties: Loudness, Speechiness, Instrumentalness
 - Context: Liveness, Acousticness
 - Segments, Tatums, Bars, Beats, Pitches, Timbre etc.

Another powerful tool within the developer platform is the ability to create recommendations for listeners by utilising the above metrics with Spotify's own algorithms.

There are certain limitations to what can be extracted for analysis. For example, only 100 songs can be extracted at a time. The playlists must also be public (available to be viewed by everyone, not just the user running the reports). This project will analyse two playlists:

 - UK Top 50
 - UK Viral 50

Two playlists focusing on one localised area, both looking at popular songs but with varying results. The Top 50 playlist collates the most streamed songs on Spotify at the time. However, the Viral 50 playlist also takes the user interactions into account (sharing to blogs, social media for example). By delving deeper into these playlists using the developer platform we can analyse the type of songs that are top/viral & compare the shape of the two playlists.

Please note, the playlist data is accurate as of 01/07/2022
